# ContentForge API

ContentForge is an API built with **FastAPI** for automating the creation of blog articles on a WordPress site. This application is designed to support **affiliate marketing** by generating high-quality content efficiently. The UI for ContentForge is built with Angular and is available [here](https://github.com/alexandru-pestritu/ContentForgeUI).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Affiliate Store Management** üè™  
  Users can add and manage affiliate stores in the database effortlessly. Each store is defined with relevant details, including the store name, base URL, and optional favicon, enabling seamless integration and organization of products linked to specific stores.

- **Automated Product Data Scraping** üõí  
  Users can add products by providing the product's affiliate URL. The API utilizes **BeautifulSoup4** and **Crawlbase** to scrape detailed product information, including descriptions, specifications, images, and other relevant data. This automation ensures that the most current and accurate information is available for use in articles, eliminating manual entry.

- **Article Creation with Product Integration** ‚úçÔ∏è  
  Users can create articles while specifying the associated products. The articles can incorporate scraped product data, enhancing the content's value and relevance to readers. This feature allows users to build comprehensive articles that naturally incorporate product recommendations.

- **AI Content Generation for Products and Articles** ü§ñ  
  ContentForge integrates with **EdenAI**, a unified API for accessing multiple AI models, allowing users to generate high-quality AI content. Users can create product reviews, highlight pros and cons, and generate various sections of articles, including introductions, buyer's guides, FAQs, and conclusions. This flexibility enables tailored content that resonates with target audiences.

- **Custom Prompt Creation** üîç  
  Users can create and manage custom prompts with placeholders for products and articles. These placeholders dynamically insert values from product or article models, allowing for highly customizable content generation. This feature empowers users to refine the tone and style of the AI-generated content to align with their brand voice.

- **Gutenberg Blocks Layout for WordPress** üìù  
  Once an article is finalized, users can publish it directly to their WordPress site. The API generates a Gutenberg blocks layout based on the article's content and associated products, ensuring the article is well-structured and visually appealing when published. This integration simplifies the publishing process, allowing users to focus on content creation rather than technical details.

- **Stock Monitoring and Check Logs** üìâ  
  The API tracks product availability and logs stock checks, providing users with insights into stock levels and historical data. Users can view detailed logs that include check times, in-stock counts, and out-of-stock counts, enabling better inventory management and timely updates to articles based on product availability.

- **SEO Optimization Features** üöÄ  
  Articles can be enhanced with SEO features such as keywords, meta titles, and meta descriptions. Users can input these details while creating articles, improving the chances of their content ranking higher in search engine results and attracting more organic traffic.

- **Secure Authentication & User Management** üîí  
  ContentForge ensures secure access to its API through JWT token-based authentication. Users must authenticate to access specific operations, safeguarding sensitive data and allowing for effective user management within the application.
